		<p><h3>Intellectual Experience: Wolfeboro Public Library Collection Development Policy</h3></p>

		<p>On <a href="#" onclick="popup('/web/20141208154402/http://www.wolfeboronh.us/boards/Library%20Trustees/04.02.07%20agenda.pdf',800,800);">April 2, 2007</a> the Wolfeboro Public Library Board of Trustees implemented the <a href="Collection_Development_Policy_2007.doc">final draft</a> of a Collection Development policy that began as a <a href="FinalRoughCDP.doc">final project</a> for a group of students in LIS522, Collection Development.  During winter quarter of 2006, Cindy Scott, Library Director for the Wolfeboro Public Library, was delighted to find out that a group of library students from the University of Washington were interested in creating a collection development policy for a rural library located on the East Coast - one of her goals for 2007 was to create a new collection development policy for the library.  The old policy was mimeographed and made no references to electronic resources.  This excerpt from an e-mail sent by Cindy early in the project provides insight into the condition of the existing policy:</p>

<p class="indented">The previous administration did not really believe in weeding the library collection. I actually found a three volume set of science encyclopedias on the reference shelf, shortly after I began working here 4 1/2 years ago, that stated that someday there would be manned space flight. So a section on weeding is very important.</p> 

<p>As a group, we worked together to create a policy that was relevant and reflected the collection development goals of the current administration.</p>

<p>The success of our policy was dependent upon our ability to educate ourselves about Wolfeboro from here in Washington.  This meant working closely with Cindy and utilizing resources, both academic and community-based to learn about the town.  The town of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire is an old resort destination located on Lake Winnipesaukee.  The legal service area for the Wolfeboro Public Library is within the Wolfeboro city limits. However, the actual service area extends beyond the town limits to provide library services to the surrounding community.  Non-residents may obtain a library card for an annual family fee of $40.00.  In addition, Wolfeboro's reputation for being "The Oldest Summer Resort in America" brings an estimated 25,000 visitors annually.  The library provides summer residents with temporary cards that run from Memorial Day to Labor Day for $15.00.  While highly contested among locals, the population of Wolfeboro is estimated to be around 6,500.  The local population, surrounding communities and summer visitors all contribute to the library's circulation of over 120,000 items and 60, 000 branch visits a year.  Given the unique demographics of the library's patrons we had our work cut out for us.</p>   

<p>While in the end we were able to create a policy that was passed by the Wolfeboro Library Board with some revisions, the process was at times difficult. Our group endured several personal emergencies, one resulting in a member of our group temporally leaving the MLIS program.  Furthermore, since I contacted the library through a personal connection (my boyfriend's grandmother lives in Wolfeboro) my motivation to create a policy they could successfully implement extended beyond the classroom.  At times I found myself at odds with the rest of the group members and had to remind myself that their personal stake in the project was limited to receiving a grade.  These issues were perpetuated by the lack of a defined leader at the beginning of the project.  As the de facto leader this made mitigating issues as they arose more complicated.  In addition to learning how to write an effective collection development policy, I learned the importance of designating well-defined roles at the beginning of a project.</p>   

<p>Despite the hardships we encountered as a group, each individual member contributed a great deal to the overall policy and I am happy to report that a bit of each of us can be found within the revised version passed by the board.  In fact, upon comparing the final draft to our original work I was pleased to find much of the policy unchanged.</p>

<p><h3>Intellectual Experience: Cataloging <i>Working at the University of Washington</i></h3></p>

<p>In addition to course work, I have held several positions at the University of Washington that encouraged my love of metadata.  During my first year of the program I worked in Special Collections attaching metadata to images for the Digital Library collection. During this year I realized the importance of accurate description and the difficulties involved in describing objects beyond the realm of the monograph.  My research adventures for this position took me from the depths of the University Archives to the Washington State Historical Society in Tacoma.  After a year of working in Special Collections I yearned for an experience that included more cataloging.  I was fortunate enough to have a friend who suggested that I apply for a job in Database Management here at the UW.</p>

<div class="captionLeft"><a href="catalognote.jpg" target="_new"><img src="smallcatalognote.jpg"></a><p>Click on image to enlarge UW catalog record</p></a></div>
<p>It is a joke within Database Management that I hired myself for the position I currently have.  I was so excited during the interview that instead of asking, "<i>If</i> I am hired, when is the start date?"  I asked, "So, when do I start?"  The manager and supervisor interviewing me were so surprised by my assertiveness that they gave me the position.  That was last June and I am still working in DMS.  My work in DMS has made my love of cataloging grow and blossom into a committed relationship.  Not only do I receive firsthand experience copy cataloging Government Publications from OCLC, I also perform minimal level original cataloging in OCLC.  My records (while short) are in OCLC for the world to discover and perhaps copy catalog for use within another institution.  (Click on the Univeristy of Washington Libraries catalog record on the left to view the first known item to be requested via Summit from a record I created.)  I also completed a Directed Fieldwork at the University of Washington Libraries within the Monographic Services Division cataloging non-book materials.</p> 
	
<p><h3>Intellectual Experience: Federated Search <i>Keeping the Dream Alive</i></h3></p>
<p>While not seemingly significant in terms of overall impact, <a href="federatedsearch.doc">this example</a> of an intellectual work was the first time in my library school career that I felt I had enough background knowledge about a topic to create an opinion piece.  Library Technology Systems (LIS587) was one of the best classes I took at the University of Washington and I would highly recommend it to any library student.  I felt the course was an accumulation of everything I had learned through class and work since I started the program in fall of 2006.  While not entirely academic in nature, this paper about federated search is a reflection of my ability to critically discuss library technologies.</p>
