                <h3>
                    Introduction</h3>
                When I applied for the Master of Library and Information Science program at the University of Washington I intended to fulfill my dream of transforming myself into my grade school librarian. Things have changed quite a bit from the days of the card catalog and 16 millimeter projectors that my mentor taught me how to use.  Within the last two years I have learned how to catalog electronic resources and create the web site you are currently viewing.  The world of information has expanded from book and film to include forms of media my sixth grade brain could have never conceived.  Not even the most prolific of science fiction novels could have accurately documented the technological changes that have occurred within the last 13 years.  These changes make the role of the librarian equally as important from when I was a kid – a library database is just as intimidating as the card catalog.  Just like Ms. Jeffery’s, I am excited to help library patrons learn how use to the resources available to them in order to fulfill their information needs.  </p>
            <p>
                I focused my time within the MLIS program on <i>how</i> libraries make their many resources available to patrons.   It is interesting how each of the subject areas I studied informed one another.   For example, I owe my success as a researcher to understanding the process of cataloging.  Much like there are people who have a strong, opinionated preference for wine or cannot stand the taste, there are those of us who either love cataloging or hate it.  I am not a "natural" cataloger. The rules of the AACR2 manual still confuse me from time to time and I am not exactly sure if I will always be able to correctly identify a serial from reviewing just a few examples.  However, understanding how these items are processed and cataloged gives me a competitive advantage within the world of information.  Give me a person with a desire to learn and I will find them a variety of resources and show them how to use them. 
            <p>
              The example above and the rest of this portfolio document only a few of the many significant experiences I have had over the last two years that are representative of my development from a user and admirer of the library into a Librarian.  Please explore the rest of the site and I promise you will find that my palette is varied and complementary.  I was attracted to this profession because I wanted a future full of adventurous learning and these experiences simply mark the beginning of many more to come!</p>
