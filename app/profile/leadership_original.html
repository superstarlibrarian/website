		<p><h3>Leadership: Assistant Producer at Seattle Public Library Branch Openings</h3>When Anne Vedella, Volunteer Coordinator with the Seattle Public Library, asked if I would be interested in assisting the Event Coordinator at branch openings I gladly accepted.  Up until this point my volunteer duties including assisting at the children’s craft table and filling in where necessary.  I figured the title Assistant Producer was a fancy title for generally the same work.  After my first meeting with the event producer Karen O’Connor I realized I was wrong and wondered if I was up to the challenge.</p>  

<p>As part of the 'Libraries for All' bond measure passed by Seattle voters in 1998 many of the existing branches of the Seattle Public Library were redesigned or rebuilt.  Upon the completion of each branch SPL hosts a celebration to introduce the new library to the community.  These branch openings require a great deal of organization in order to run smoothly.  As Assistant Producer, I work closely with those in charge to make sure any problems encountered along the way are seamless to library patrons and public officials.</p>  

<p>I have learned when dealing with so many variables, one can only expect to encounter challenges.  The ability to effectively and efficiently deal with problems as they arise has been a recurring theme for me throughout the MLIS program.  As Assistant Producer, I have had several experiences that show how I have transformed from someone who felt she was not up to challenge into someone who is relied upon for her leadership skills.</p>

<p>In addition to my regular responsibilities that include attending to the children’s craft table and leading the parade of dignitaries that begins each branch opening, I am often called upon to assist volunteers and staff when the unexpected occurs.  (Click <a href="#" onclick="popup('/web/20141209050631/http://www.seattlechannel.org/videos/video.asp?ID=1060654',800,800);")">here</a> to see video of Lorraine leading the parade at Northgate Branch Opening). The Northgate branch opening gave me an opportunity to put my leadership skills to work when an unanticipated jam in the parking lot created problems for library patrons and security staff.  The traffic backup would have been much worse if it was not for the diligence of the security staff.  When security approached me with the problem I worked with them to close off the parking lot, block the lane entering the lot and create signs to redirect traffic. This is not something I would have been able to do months before when I avoided sticky situations out of fear of doing something wrong.  The implicit trust the event producer has in my leadership skills combined with the practical skills I have gained by watching other leaders act under pressure has transformed me into someone who now sees these challenges as unstructured learning events.  Every time I am faced with a challenge I become that much better at dealing with the next one to come.</p>

<p>In fact at the next branch opening I would encounter another situation that would challenge my role as a leader.  As mentioned above, I am in charge of setting up and maintaining the children’s craft table during the openings.  Because I have been a volunteer at these openings since the Central Branch opening in May of 2004 I know most of the regulars and have an important relationship with them.  The children’s table is often one of  the busiest (and messiest) areas of the opening and these volunteers work hard to make sure each patron leaves happy.  At the Douglass Truth branch opening one of the volunteers approached me to express her concern over how we were setting up the craft table at the openings.  While having the tables low to the floor met the needs of the children, it made it uncomfortable for our volunteers – so uncomfortable that a few talked of not coming back unless we made some changes.  At this time I also asked the volunteer if she had any additional concerns and found out that more frequent breaks along with shorter volunteer shifts were desired.  I passed this information along to the volunteer coordinator and made the severity of the situation very clear to her by stressing that the library could not stand to lose these dedicated volunteers.  By the next opening the shifts had been changed, more breaks had been provided and the tables were raised off the floor.  The highlight of the situation was being personally thanked by the volunteer, who, in taking on a leadership role of her own was a catalyst for change.  Leadership is contagious; if you are willing to put yourself out there you might catch it and become a leader in turn.</p>
