        <p><h3>Technology Experience: Podcasting presentation by Stephen Abram</h3><p>Before starting this program my technology skills were limited to those I encountered at work.  This included working with programmers to fix problems with our in-house software program and translating technical jargon into easily understandable language for non-techies.  While this background makes me well prepared to bridge the gap between technology services and library patrons, I entered the program with no practical technical skills that might be employed to enhance library operations. Professional library publications have been discussing for some time the many different ways podcasts can be utilized within libraries to foster knowledge sharing.  Thus, when the UW Special Libraries Association needed someone to podcast a presentation by Stephen Abram I jumped at the chance to learn about this exciting technology.</p> 

<p>With a little searching on the Internet I was able to locate a resource that would teach me step by step, with minimal cost, how to create a podcast. <a href="#" onclick="popup('/web/20141209034122/http://www.how-to-podcast-tutorial.com/',800,800);">(http://www.how-to-podcast-tutorial.com/)</a> As covered within LIS540, project management is the key tool in making sure any new technology is implemented successfully.  After working with the program organizers to confirm that Mr. Abram would not mind being recorded, I downloaded the necessary software, borrowed the required hardware and created practice podcasts.  SLA had already advertised that the event would be podcasted so I wanted to make sure that I made no mistakes.</p>

<p>The main problem encountered during the project materialized a few days before the presentation.  We realized that I had not made provisions for a second recording in case we had problems with the first.  Luckily I was able to borrow another recorder the day before the event.  This became especially notable when one of the recorders malfunctioned during the lecture.  When dealing with technology one should anticipate everything and expect nothing â€“ always have a backup method in place!</p>  

<p>The most difficult and important part of creating a podcast is making sure the audio is clear and contains minimal background noise.  I was shocked to listen to the initial recording and fearful that the free audio software I downloaded would not be enough to make the podcast listenable.  Despite my reservations, the Audacity software was easy to use.  I was able to reduce background interference which resulted in better clarity.  While not perfect, the <a href="#" onclick="popup('/web/20141209034122/http://students.washington.edu/slauw/StephenAbram/Stephenabram.mp3',500,300)">final Mp3</a> is definitely listenable. I once again employed the use of a free software application to generate the necessary XML to create an rss feed for the podcast.  I then used simple HTML to make both the rss feed and Mp3 available to the public via the SLA website.</p>  

<p>As a future cataloger, I would like to use rss feeds internally to update staff about changes in rules.  Furthermore, these podcasts would be made available to all staff so those on the cataloging periphery (for example acquisitions) could listen as well.  The next time I embark on creating a podcast I will make sure to find a better microphone and plan for the unexpected. </p>
