                <h1>Leadership: Assistant Producer at Seattle Public Library Branch Openings</h1>
                <p>
            	When Anne Vedella, Volunteer Coordinator with the Seattle Public Library, asked if I would be interested in assisting the Event Coordinator at new branch openings I gladly accepted.  Up until this point my volunteer duties including assisting at the children's craft table and filling in where necessary.  I figured the title Assistant Producer was a fancy title for generally the same work.  After my first meeting with the event producer Karen O’Connor I realized I was wrong and wondered if I was up to the challenge.
            	</p>  

            	<p>
            	As part of the 'Libraries for All' bond measure passed by Seattle voters in 1998 many of the existing branches of the Seattle Public Library were redesigned or rebuilt.  Upon the completion of each branch SPL hosted a celebration to introduce the new library to the community.  In order to run smoothly the branch openings required a great deal of organization.  As Assistant Producer, I worked closely with those in charge to make sure any problems encountered along the way were seamless to library patrons and public officials.
            	</p>  

            	<p>
            	I have learned when dealing with so many variables, one can only expect to encounter challenges.  The ability to effectively and efficiently deal with problems as they arise has been a recurring theme for me throughout the MLIS program.  As Assistant Producer, I have had several experiences that show how I have transformed from someone who felt she was not up to challenge into someone who is relied upon for her leadership skills.
            	</p>

            	<p>
            	In addition to my regular responsibilities that included attending to the children’s craft table and leading the parade of dignitaries that begins each branch opening, I was often called upon to assist volunteers and staff when the unexpected occured.  The Northgate branch opening gave me an opportunity to put my leadership skills to work when an unanticipated jam in the parking lot created problems for library patrons and security staff.  The traffic backup would have been much worse if it was not for the diligence of the security staff.  When security approached me with the problem I worked with them to close off the parking lot, block the lane entering the lot and created signs to redirect traffic. This is not something I would have been able to do months before when I avoided sticky situations out of fear of doing something wrong.  The implicit trust the event producer had in my leadership skills combined with the practical skills I gained by watching other leaders act under pressure has transformed me into someone who now sees these challenges as unstructured learning events.
